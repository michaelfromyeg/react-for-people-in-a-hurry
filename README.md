# React for People in a Hurry (Intro to Web Development with React)

Your one-stop shop for an introduction to web development, using the React ~~framework~~ [library](https://reactjs.org/).

To be presented at TOHacks 2022's in-person workshop series in Toronto, Ontario on Friday, May 27th. [Join us](https://app.tohacks.ca)! Theme inspiration plagiarized from an old workshop of mine, [Data Science for People in a Hurry](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/data-science-for-people-in-a-hurry).

## About 🤔
